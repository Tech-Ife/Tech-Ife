## 🔐 Cybersecurity Specialist | Former Financial & Project Manager | Threat Hunter in Training

Hi, I'm Ifeanyi Christian Edeh — a cybersecurity practitioner with a foundation in financial operations and project delivery. After years managing risk and budgets in high-stakes environments, I pivoted into cybersecurity to protect what matters most: people, data, and infrastructure.

### 🧠 I specialize in:
- Digital Forensics & Incident Response (DFIR)
- Governance, Risk & Compliance (GRC)
- Python & Bash Scripting for automation
- Vulnerability Assessments & SIEM monitoring
- NIST, MITRE ATT&CK & ISO 27001 frameworks

### 📁 Featured Projects
My repositories showcase hands-on projects built during my Lighthouse Labs Cybersecurity Bootcamp — including:
- **Forensic Investigations** (memory/disk analysis, network traffic capture)
- **Risk Management Plans** (NIST/ISO-compliant documentation)
- **Secure Server Deployments** (SSH hardening, segmentation, logging)
- **Automation Tools** like [LogHawk](https://github.com/Tech-ife/LogHawk): a real-time log monitoring tool with email alerts.
